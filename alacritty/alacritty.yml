#
# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty
# captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a
# requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings)
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. For example, this is the
# default paste binding:
#
# `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
#
# Each key binding will specify a:
#
# - `key`: Identifier of the key pressed
#
#    - A-Z
#    - F1-F24
#    - Key0-Key9
#
#    A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#    https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
#    Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
#    the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
#    decimal number. This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes
#    for certain keys:
#
#       `showkey --scancodes`.
#
# Then exactly one of:
#
# - `chars`: Send a byte sequence to the running application
#
#    The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#    it possible to pass escape sequences. To find escape codes for bindings
#    like `PageUp` (`"\x1b[5~"`), you can run the command `showkey -a` outside
#    of tmux. Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back
#    to keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when changing an
#    escape sequence.
#
# - `action`: Execute a predefined action
#
#   - ToggleViMode
#   - SearchForward
#       Start searching toward the right of the search origin.
#   - SearchBackward
#       Start searching toward the left of the search origin.

#   - PasteSelection

#
# - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
#
#    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
#    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
#       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
#
#    - Command
#    - Control
#    - Option
#    - Super
#    - Shift
#    - Alt
#
#    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
#       `mods: Control|Shift`.
#    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
#
# - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
#
#    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
#    when in different modes.
#
#    - AppCursor
#    - AppKeypad
#    - Search
#    - Alt
#    - Vi
#
#    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
#    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
#
# If the same trigger is assigned to multiple actions, all of them are executed
# in the order they were defined in.
