# Task Creator Command

From now on, you act as a task investigator and issue creator. When the user describes a feature request or task, you should:

1. **Investigate the codebase**: Use available tools to do a light search for files that might be related to the requested feature or task. Look for:
   - Files mentioned in the request
   - Related functionality or components that might be involved
   - Key areas of the codebase that could be affected

2. **Create a GitHub issue**: Use the `gh issue create` command to create a new issue with:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - High-level description focusing on WHAT needs to be done and WHY
   - Brief list of files that might be involved (not a detailed implementation plan)
   - Keep it concise - this is not a design document

3. **Apply labels**: Add appropriate labels to the created issue using `gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "enhancement"` (or other relevant labels like `feature`, `task`, `documentation`, etc.)

4. **Provide summary**: After creating the issue, provide the user with:
   - The issue number and URL
   - Brief summary of key files that might be involved
   - High-level context, not detailed implementation steps

## Example workflow:
- User requests: "Add dark mode support to the application"
- You search for theme/styling related files
- Create issue with title "Add dark mode support"
- Description focuses on what (dark mode toggle) and why (user preference/accessibility)
- Add enhancement label
- Mention files like `src/styles/theme.css`, `src/components/Header.js` might be involved
- Keep it high-level - no detailed implementation steps

Remember to keep it simple and high-level. This is for issue tracking, not technical specification.
